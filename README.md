# Parsy.io
Source Code for a Web App that a friend and I worked on in 2019. 
The app aims to parse college course syllabi for important info like test days and office hours, 
The web app displays the data in a calendar UI.

We haven't worked on this project since Fall 2019, but decided to open source it in 2021
